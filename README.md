# üé¨ MultiModal RAG with Videos

**MultiModal RAG with Videos** is an advanced, AI-powered application that enables users to extract and interact with both visual and textual content from YouTube videos. By integrating state-of-the-art language models (LLMs), this tool allows users to ask complex questions about a video‚Äôs content, using a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach. The app processes video, audio, and frames to provide context-aware, accurate responses.

üöÄ Features
- **Download and Process YouTube Videos**: Automatically download YouTube videos, extract key frames, and transcribe audio.
- **MultiModal Indexing**: Use both visual (frames) and textual (transcribed audio) data to create a multi-modal vector store, enhancing query accuracy.
- **Real-time Question Answering**: Ask questions about the content of the video and receive detailed answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT-4-turbo multimodal model.
- **Customizable Video Queries**: Users can input any YouTube video and ask questions about its specific sections, making it ideal for deep dives into educational, tutorial, or any video content.
- **Streamlit Interface**: Clean and user-friendly UI built using Streamlit for seamless interaction.
